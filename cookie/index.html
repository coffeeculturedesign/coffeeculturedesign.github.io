                <h3>What are cookies</h3>
                <p>
                    Cookies are small text files that are stored on your device when you visit a website. They allow the
                    website
                    to remember your actions and preferences over a period of time, so you don’t have to re-enter them
                    each time
                    you visit. Cookies can be set by the website you are visiting (first-party cookies) or by
                    third-party services
                    like analytics and advertising networks (third-party cookies). Their primary function is to enhance
                    your
                    browsing experience and help websites perform certain actions efficiently.

                <h3>How we use cookies</h3>
                <p>
                    We use cookies primarily to store an approximate location of the user to automatically set the
                    appropriate
                    region for browsing, ensuring that content and prices are relevant to the user’s location. These
                    cookies
                    improve user experience by streamlining region-specific settings, so you don’t have to manually
                    select your
                    region every time you visit the site. Additionally, cookies help us analyze user behavior on our
                    website,
                    allowing us to improve site performance and usability. Some cookies also serve marketing purposes by
                    enabling
                    personalized ads. The cookies we use generally last for 30 days, after which they expire.

                <h3>Your choices about cookies</h3>
                <p>
                    You have the ability to control and manage cookies through your browser settings. Most browsers
                    allow you to
                    block or delete cookies, and you can also set preferences for receiving notifications when cookies
                    are being
                    used. Keep in mind, however, that disabling certain cookies may impact your experience on our site,
                    such as
                    needing to manually choose your region or losing saved preferences. You can also opt out of cookies
                    used for
                    personalized advertising or analytics by visiting third-party opt-out platforms.

                <h3>How long do cookies last</h3>
                <p>
                    The duration of cookies varies depending on their type. Session cookies are temporary and are
                    deleted when you
                    close your browser, while persistent cookies remain on your device for a specified period or until
                    you choose
                    to delete them. Our cookies, which store the approximate location for regional settings, last for 30
                    days.
                    Third-party cookies, such as those used for analytics or advertising, may have different expiration
                    periods,
                    as determined by their respective providers.
